## What is GNA

GNA is your comprehensive API endpoint for anything Elite Dangerous.

Originally intended to supply Galnet News data in a simple JSON API. GNA has been enhanced to pull information from multiple resources to provide a detailed JSON API for multiple resources including:

- Galnet News
- Commodities
- Systems
- Stations

The following additional features are not yet implemented, but are planned

- PowerPlay (rankings, controlled systems, etc...)
- Community Goals
- Ships
- Ship components
- Ship modules


## What information can I get with GNA?

GNA sources data from multiple sources (EDDB, INARA, Galnet Community News). Listed below is all the information you can currently retrieve through GNA.

## How to use GNA?

Be sure to reference the [docs/](docs/) folder for more information about each API endpoint.

Want to use GNA without setting up your own server? You can fetch data from [https://www.galnet.news](https://www.galnet.news).

> Note: Current data and usage is available for free, but hosting is not :(. If you want to donate to keep GNA up and free please contact me directly. Additionally, if you plan on doing massive data analysis, consider running GNA on your own servers.
